# Who Uses Pixelearn
Since it is designed more specifically for andriod applications, Pixelearn is useful for people who use andriod devices and want to commit to creating digital art, given the fact that it is not often we see digital-art-based learning/tutorial apps, specifically for andriod devices. Pixelearn is also very beginner friendly, which uses video tutorials, as well as quizess that include tracing help, showing the step-by-step process of the artwork, as well as the step-by-step process on how to use each of the tools provided like brushes, layers, etc.
