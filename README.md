# ðŸŒŸ Pixelearn
Pixelearn is an art based learning app for android applications. It has a series of lessons for categories such as brushes, colors, layers, clipping an alpha lock, selection and masks, and blending mode, as well as settings which allow the user to adjust them to however they see fit. Each module will include general lessons which include videos and an interactive sandbox. It will also tests the users knowledge with quizzes.


# Who Uses Pixelearn
Since it is designed more specifically for andriod applications, Pixelearn is useful for people who use andriod devices and want to commit to creating digital art, given the fact that it is not often we see digital-art-based learning/tutorial apps, specifically for andriod devices. Pixelearn is also very beginner friendly, which uses video tutorials, as well as quizess that include tracing help, showing the step-by-step process of the artwork, as well as the step-by-step process on how to use each of the tools provided like brushes, layers, etc.

> How Pixelearn is used:

The user starts with opening the app and the main menu is what they would see first. Included in the main menu, is the set of topics/techniques the user can choose from, depending on what it is they want to learn or get better at. Then, the user would be taken to another set, which includes the lessons specifically for that topic, which is followed by an in depth video tutorial on how to use and navigate the tool, as well as on how to apply it to artwork. Along with a video is a trancript included for the user's preference in case they miss something, which can be identified easily, instead of them having to pause the video and rewind the video to see what they missed. Also along with the video, is a sandbox for the user to use and follow with the video, either while the video is playing, or while it is paused. Once the user feels confident enough to move on, they will be prompted to take a quiz, based on accuracy through a tracing tool. For the quiz, the user will trace over what they are prompted to (in a sandbox), which would be something in relation to the video, and they will then be graded on how accurately they were able to trace over it. After that, the user is able to move onto the next topics and techniques, which the process repeats for all the topics as well as for the quizzess going forward.
